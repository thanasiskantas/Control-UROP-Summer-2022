# Control-UROP-Summer-2022
The project report for the Undergraduate Research done in the summer of 2022 at Imperial College London.
The research was in applying modern multi-state feedback techniques using the 7D state-space representation of the 2DoF Quadrotor. 
A Dynamic Observer was also implemented to estimate the unobservable states of the system.

1. The MATLAB livescript file is attached, containing the derivation and the values of all matrices used in the model.
2. The Simulink file is attached, containing the simulation of the complete closed loop drone model.
3. A report of the project is included, containing all the details and steps of the project
